# TankWarGame

这是我在大二期间课余完成的一个利用C++ Irrilicht（鬼火）游戏引擎开发的3D射击坦克的游戏。
利用粒子效果完成了坦克着火，炮弹射击等效果。并完成了得分系统，血量伤害计算系统，坦克可以向玩家开火并向玩家的方向移动。
（This is a game developed by C++ Irrilicht Game Development Engine whose theme is shooting the tanks. By means of the Paticle Effect provided by the game engine, I complete the tank ablazing and tank shooting effect. In addition, this game has score calculation system and injury calculation system which provided 3 kinds of bullets. The tanks also know moving toward the postion of player and shooting toward player.）
